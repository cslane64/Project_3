# Project_3

The State Contact Portal allows a designate person from each of the Mutistate Tax Commission's member states to manange their states contact information.

The app on line currently is the base on which this fucntionality will built. The technology used is:
- Node
- Express
- MySQL
- React
- Materail-UI
- Bcrypt
- React-Data-Grid
- React-Bootstrap
- Heroku

You can click Register to add yourself as a User. As the app progresses, all users will either be 'approved' by or 'entered' by the MTC Network Admin. As a user, you will be able to add, edit and delete contacts with the same locality (state) as you.

In the future, I am hopeful to integrate MS Graph API to integrate directly with our Office 365 Exchange online lailing list.

You can look around by using my credentials cslane@gmail.com password = password.

Enjoy.
